A 2D time-dependent finite-difference MATLAB solver for the Navier-Stokes equations on non-uniform cartesian meshes with staggered grids.

The spatial derivatives are computed with 2nd order accuracy.

Time integration is performed with adaptive-stepping of either explicit Runge-Kutta (3rd or 5th order) or Implicit ESDIRK methods (3rd or 5th order).
